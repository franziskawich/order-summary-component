## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS saved as CSS
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After a long break, I re-learned a lot with this little project. I wrote down some steps of my workflow, because it was a bit overwhelming how much I forgot during this break, and now I have a document to use when I get stuck and don't know what I usually do next. ðŸ™‚ I realized again that I have some problems with positioning background images. I played around with the zoom of different browsers to see what's really going on and read a few articles on MDN Web Docs about background CSS properties. I also re-read the BEM naming convention and flex properties, among other things.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: Button vs. Links](https://css-tricks.com/buttons-vs-links/) - This helped me remember which HTML element, `<button>` or `<a href="">`, I should use in this scenario.
